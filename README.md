# TechCon 2024 Conference Website üåê

This is my project for building a **multi-page website** for the **TechCon 2024 conference** using only **HTML**. The goal of the project was to practice and demonstrate essential HTML concepts while creating a professional, accessible, and well-structured site.

## üéØ What I Practiced

While working on this project, I got hands-on practice with:

- Structuring pages using semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)  
- Organizing headings (`<h1>`‚Äì`<h6>`) and paragraphs effectively  
- Linking multiple pages together using `<a>` tags  
- Building an accessible schedule with `<table>`, `<th>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<caption>`  
- Designing forms with different input types (`text`, `email`, `password`, `checkbox`, `textarea`)  
- Adding multimedia elements like images, videos, and an embedded Google Map  
- Keeping accessibility in mind with alt attributes and proper structure
